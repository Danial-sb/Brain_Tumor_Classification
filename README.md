### **The aim of this project is to predict whether a patient has any kind of tumor or not based on a MRI brain images.**


## **Steps Involved**
1- Import all the necessary modules & load the data.  
2- Observe the data and determine the number of output classes (4 in this case).   
3- Partitioning the the dataset into training, validation, and test datasets.   
4- Define a CNN model and doing the evaluation.   
5- Perform Transfer learning method (in this case VGG16) to classify brain tumors.   
6- Comparing the performance of the models.
